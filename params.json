{"name":"FRC Recycle Rush Vision Solution","tagline":"Finds target rotation using depth map","body":"### What is FIRST?\r\nFIRST (For Inspiration and Recognition of Science and Technology) sponsors FIRST Robotics Competition every year with a new game type. This is a solution using computer vision that is applicable to the challenge.\r\n\r\n### What features does this provide?\r\nThis allows for detection of the grey tote, the yellow tote, and the recycle bin (green bin internally). It provides for the rotation to line up with each object as well as orientation for strafing to the short side of a box. It returns how many totes are in a stack and whether a stack has a recycle bin on top of it.\r\n\r\n### Contributors\r\nThe program was created by Team 1706, Ratchet Rocker Robotics. Connor is the lead/teacher and Hunter is now technically a mentor but did most programming.\r\n\r\nTeam members:\r\n* Connor Monahan\r\n* Zachary Tibbetts\r\n* Brian Mongoven\r\n* Joey Flynn\r\n* Nikolos Antonio\r\n* Joe Yagelowich\r\n\r\nMentors:\r\n* Hunter Park\r\n* Joe Flynn\r\n* JP Yagelowich\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
